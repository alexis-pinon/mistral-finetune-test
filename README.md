# mistral-finetune-test
The objective of the test is to assess your ability to adapt to a dataset, model, and fine tuning solution.

## Requirements
* Dataset https://huggingface.co/datasets/GEM/viggo
* Finetuning solution https://github.com/mistralai/mistral-finetune
* Model : Mistral 7B


## Task
The final goal is to be able to produce a sentence in natural language based on a "meaning representation". You should evaluate the starting accuracy and the accuracy after the fine tuning and suggest improvements if needed.

The outcome should be a jupyter notebook commited in a fork of this repository.
